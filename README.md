# COMPITEST
Java Compiler Project for Theory of Programming Language Course

# Description

Our project is a GUI application for performing lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis on source code. It allows users to analyze code step-by-step, displaying results for each stage in a dedicated Result Text Area. Users can load source code files into the Code Text Area to initiate analysis. Key features include:

* Lexical Analysis: Identifies tokens and processes the structure of the code, enabling the syntax analysis button after successful results.
* Syntax Analysis: Checks the grammatical structure, activating semantic analysis upon success.
* Semantic Analysis: Verifies the logical consistency of the code.
* Reset Functionality: Clears all input and output fields for reusability.
* User-friendly controls ensure buttons are only enabled when prerequisites are met.

This tool is designed to demonstrate the individual roles of lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis in a streamlined and interactive manner.
